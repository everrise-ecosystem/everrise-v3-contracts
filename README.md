[EverRiseâ€™s innovative staking protocol](https://everrise.com/everstake/) provides stakers with on-chain NFTs that securely store staking contracts directly within your DeFi wallet.

![Ecosystem](https://data.everrise.com/images/nft-stakes.png)


Stake your holdings to earn a share of the tokens purchased through the automated buyback protocol. Tokens purchased by the auto-buyback are distributed among all the stakers instantly.


Stake your tokens in month-long increments between 1 and 12 months as well as longer periods as 24 and 36 months, and earn rewards proportional to the amount of tokens staked, weighted by the length of time you have staked your tokens.
